An ad-hoc standard format for storing survey questions.

GENERAL:
1. Lines that include no more than whitespace are ignored.
2. Whitespace at the beginning and end of each line is ignored.
3. Each line is terminated by a newline.

***
QUESTIONS:

1. Each question begins on a new line and the letter "Q" followed by whitespace. Whitespace before the "Q" is ignored.
2. Two comma-separated values should then be provided:
   -a type: "int", "float", "string", "longstring", or "enum".
   -a name for the question which should be short, should not contain whitespace, and should not contain "//".
3. The characters "//" should follow.  Whitespace around it is ignored.
4. There should then be a human-readable newline-terminated description of the question as it would display on a survey form.

***
CHOICES

For questions of type "enum", choices should be provided on subsequent lines in the following format:
1. The letter "C", followed by whitespace.  Whitespace before "C" is ignored.
2. A programatically-readable name for the option (a potential value of the enum) which should not contain whitespace.
3. The character "//". Whitespace following or preceding it is ignored.
4. A newline-terminated human-readable name for the choice.
